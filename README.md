# sales-management-fastapi
I built a full-stack sales management system with a normalized MySQL database, FastAPI backend with full CRUD, and a responsive Bootstrap frontend. The repo includes the SQL schema, backend API with validation, and a modern UI with real-time updates. It’s fully functional and I’ve prepared a live demo to walk through the features.
